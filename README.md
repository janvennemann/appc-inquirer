# interrogate

node.js prompt module for asking the same questions different ways

## overview

`interrogate` aims to provide an identical API for interactive prompting that works for both CLI input and data delivered via socket.

## interrogate(questions, opts, callback)

* `questions` - array of [questions objects](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/#question), as defined in the inquirer.js documentation
* `opts` - optional object for passing options to the `interrogate()` call
* `callback` - function executed upon completion. It receives the following parameters:
	* `err` - error object, if there was an error, falsy otherwise
	* `answers` - object containing the key/value pairs of question name and answer

```js
var interrogate = require('interrogate');

interrogate([{ 
  name: 'myField', 
  type: 'input' 
}], function(err, answers) {
	if (err) { /* do error handling */ }
  console.log('The answer to question "myField" is ' + answers.myField);
});
```

It's job is to deliver a series of questions to a user, allow the user to answer those questions, do any necessary processing on those answers (validation, filtering, etc...), and then pass those answers back to the program that invoked `interrogate()`. The below sections details how this API can be used for both CLI input processing, as well as input delivered via socket communications. 

## CLI prompting

When using `interrogate` to get input from the CLI, it is simply a thin wrapper over [inquirer.js][]. The API can be used identically to the documentation listed on the inquirer.js site, with a single exception. In the inquirer.js API, `prompt()` returns only an `answers` object to its callback. The `interrogate()` function instead returns an `err` object and `answers` object to tis callback. 

```js
interrogate([{ 
  name: 'myField', 
  type: 'input' 
}], function(err, answers) {
	if (err) { /* do error handling */ }
  console.log('The answer to question "myField" is ' + answers.myField);
});
```

Other than this above change, all other usage for CLI input processing is identical to inquirer.js and there's no sense in repeating it here. Please refer to the [inquirer.js][] docs for any further details.

## socket-based prompting

> _As of right now, the only intended use case for this is Appcelerator Studio. The documentation will be updated to support other avenues of usage is necessary._

### client-side

As noted above in the [CLI prompting](#cli-prompting) section, [inquirer.js][] is the foundation for this API. On the client-side, it is invoked and fed data back just like the inquirer.js API. To tell `interrogate` to use the socket interface rather than the default CLI interface, you'd do the following:

```js
// just like in the CLI case 
var questions = [{ name: 'myField', type: 'input' }];

// we give it options to indicate we're using socket prompting,
// and that we want to specify a port for the communication
var opts = { 
  socket: true,
  port: 19191 // optional, uses 22212 by default
};

// prompt exactly as in the CLI case
interrogate(questions, opts, function(err, answers) {
  if (err) { /* do error handling */ }
  console.log('The answer to question "myField" is ' + answers.myField);
});
``` 

As far as how to create a list of questions and process the answers, refer to the [inquirer.js][] documentation.

### server-side

The server side requires a simple TCP server listening on an agreed upon port. As noted above, the default port for `interrogate` is `22212`, but is configurable via `opts.port`. Here is the flow for how the client-side sends a question to the the server and how the server sends back a response.

1. client connects to server on specified port
2. client sends the server a [JSON question request](#question-request)
3. server parses the JSON question request and renders the question in a suitable format (in the case of Appcelerator Studio, as a user input dialog)
4. server receives user input (an answer), `JSON.stringify()`'s the answer, then sends it back to the client
5. client receives server response
    1. if client successfully parses and validates response, skip to step #8
    2. if there is a client-side error, continue to step #6
6. an [error request from client](#error-request-from-client) is sent to the server indicating the error and the question to be asked again
7. repeat from step #3 until client generates no errors
8. client saves the question/answer pair, and either
    1. has no more questions to ask, closes the connection, returns the answer object to the client's callback
    2. has more questions, repeat from step #2


#### question request

Full details of the [inquirer question object](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/#question) are in the inquirer.js documentation. This documentation should be used as a DSL for the server-side to render the questions. In the case of Appcelerator Studio, the properties and values in the question object will determine what text boxes, comboboxes, etc... will be used to query the user.

```js
{
  "type": "question",
  "question": { /* inquirer question object */ }
}
```

#### error response from server

> _not implemented, but probably will need to be at some point_

#### error request from client

These error responses from the client back to the server are sent in 2 possible cases:

1. The client cannot parse the answer sent to it by the server (not valid JSON)
2. The answer from the server fails the `validate()` function on the client-side

The `question` object in this case is the original question that generated the error. It should be asked again by the server. 

Full details of the [inquirer question object](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/#question) are in the inquirer.js documentation. This documentation should be used as a DSL for the server-side to render the questions. In the case of Appcelerator Studio, the properties and values in the question object will determine what text boxes, comboboxes, etc... will be used to query the user.

```js
{
  "type": "error",
  "message": "this is the error message from the client, can be displayed to user",
  "question": { /* inquirer question object */ }
}
```
